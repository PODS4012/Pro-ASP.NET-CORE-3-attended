        @*The HTML produced by the Thanks.cshtml view depends on the values assigned to the 
            GuestResponse view model provided by the RsvpForm action method. 
            To access the value of a property in the domain object, I use an @Model.<PropertyName> expression.
            So, for example, to get the value of the Name property, I use the @Model.Name expression*@
        <h1>Thank you, @Model.Name!</h1>
        @if (Model.WillAttend == true)
        {
            @:It's great that you're coming. The drinks are already in the fridge!
        }
        else
        {
            @:Sorry to hear that you can't make it, but thanks for letting us know.'
        }
    </div>
